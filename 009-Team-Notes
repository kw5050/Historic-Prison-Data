KW After looking at App 3: Inmates By Length of Sentence, I found it interesting how from the demographic data tab, many of the inmates were single, from the United States, and  Male. In the "Moral Instructor Notes" tab, it's clear that the inmates became involved in religion since the biggest word in the word cloud is religious and sunday. From the discharge notes, the word that stood out to me was "hope". It's clear that those that were being discharged were hopeful for the future. Lastly, from the "Crime and Place" tab, larceny was the top charge given to inmates. The map on the right shows that Philadelphia was mainly where charges were prosecuted. After looking through the data in the repo, I found that 553 charges were given in Philadelphia and these charges ranged from larceny, burglary, murder, and robbery.
